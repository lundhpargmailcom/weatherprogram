This is a start to my weather information app.
A small project during our first weeks at CHAS Academy.

After a few tries to get the libcurl and json-parts to sync with my initial program, I just scrapped it all and reworked it from scratch to avoid from annoying conflicts because of getting a rather messy code structure. There are still improvements to be made in a lot of places, but now I get the json-data to be output for the user based on the city they chose in the console.
